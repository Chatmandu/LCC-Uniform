# LCC-Uniform
## Introduction
LCC Uniform is a set Web Design Standards to set a level of simplicity and consistency across all Liverpool City Council digital services, while providing some plug-and-play design and code.

These standards are aimed at providing a single common visual style which can be flexibly applied to a broad range of council digital platforms. The Visual Style Guide on this site offers a clean, modern aesthetic that meets high standards of visual accessibility while promoting a sense of credibility, trust, and warmth in the design.

The colour palette and typography were selected to provide both consistency and flexibility. When used alongside softer colours, different font pairings from the set will communicate a classic and traditional aesthetic. The typography meets a range of layout needs; from polished marketing pages to content-heavy digital services.

The UI components are built on a solid HTML foundation, progressively enhanced to provide core experiences across browsers. All users get critical information and experiences. New browsers get the prettiest experiences, while older browsers get less pretty, but usable ones.
